# Heart Disease Prediction Model

## Overview
This repository contains a Colab-compatible machine learning model for predicting heart disease based on medical data. The model utilizes various features such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more to determine the likelihood of a person having heart disease.

## Features
- **Colab Compatibility**: Easily run the notebook in Google Colab without additional setup.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Trained using a dataset containing medical attributes.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Contains the entire workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Visualization**: Graphs and charts to help understand the data distribution.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes medical attributes such as:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest Pain Type
- Resting Blood Pressure
- Cholesterol Levels
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- Resting ECG Results
- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
- Exercise-Induced Angina
- Oldpeak (ST Depression Induced by Exercise)
- ST Segment Slope
- Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy
- Thalassemia Type

## Model & Approach
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Different models were tested, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score were used to assess model performance.

## Installation & Usage
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab:
   - Upload the `.ipynb` file to Google Drive and open with Colab.
   - Alternatively, use the following link to open Colab: [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Install the required dependencies by running the first cell in the notebook.
3. Run the notebook to train and evaluate the model.
4. Modify parameters and test different models.
5. Use the trained model to make predictions on new patient data.

## Results
The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of **X%** on the test dataset. Further improvements can be made by fine-tuning hyperparameters and using more complex architectures.

## Future Work
- Improve model performance with advanced feature selection techniques.
- Implement a web-based interface for easier user interaction.
- Deploy the model as a REST API.
